Indirect and direct speech plays an important role in the English Grammar knowledge of students. Knowing when to use direct and indirect speech can help students form grammatically correct sentences. Getting direct and indirect speech exercises is quite easy. But getting the right kind of exercise that’s appropriate for your child’s age and understanding is difficult. To relieve you of this worry, English for Tomorrow brings age-appropriate direct and indirect speech exercises. These exercises will help the children to develop a clear understanding of this topic.",

A modifier is also known as an adjunct.Modifiers that appear before the head are called pre-modifiers, while modifiers that appear after the head are called post-modifiers. Modifiers may be either restrictive (essential to the meaning of a sentence) or nonrestrictive (additional but not essential elements in a sentence). In this course we will explore modifiers in details",

    "description": "In English grammar, reference is the relationship between a grammatical unit (usually a pronoun) that refers to (or stands in for) another grammatical unit (usually a noun or noun phrase). The noun or noun phrase that a pronoun refers to is called the antecedent.A pronoun may point back to other items in a text (anaphoric reference) or—less commonly—point ahead to a later part of the text. In traditional grammar, a construction in which a pronoun doesn't refer clearly and unambiguously to its antecedent is called faulty pronoun reference. In this course we will cover pronoun reference extensively.",
